#I.	Abstract:
In this Report I will talk about the problem of Railway sleepers shift and how we can solve this problem using Image Processing. Railway contains series of sleepers that connected together and these sleepers with time they may shift a little from their original position this problem will cause with time dangerous effects for the railway which leads to distortion in railway.

#II.	Problem definition
The problem in Railway the sleepers creep with time so this creeping process we can’t notice because it’s slow and the creep extension is too small in mm this slight shift may extend with time and cause a harm distortion in the Railway so we must avoid and monitor this slight difference in some way.
#III.	Problem Solution using Image Processing

Install devices every 500 meter and each device is embedded with Camera Module, 4G module, ARM processor and power management Module for low power consumption. The device is placed 10 meters far away from the Railway in tightly fixed location to ensure no slight motion in the device otherwise the results may not be accurate. The device should be calibrated and aligned directly toward the target region of interest.
